    fastica_rpy wraps the fastICA package in R, with communication to R via rpy2. If rpy2 is not installed (or R is
    not installed), this will not work. For full documentation see the R package. To use the defaults, simpy call:

            A, W, S = fastica_rpy(X,nSources)

    Parameters:
    ------------
    X : numpy array, required
        data matrix

    nSources : integer, required
        desired number of sources to extract

    algorithm : string, optional
       "deflation" : components extracted one at a time
       "parallel"  : components extracted all at once

    nonlinearity: string, optional
       should be either "logcosh" or "exp"

    method : string, optional
       should be either "R" (to do the calculations in R) or
       "C" (to use the C library R is wrapping)

    maxIterations : integer, optional
       number of fixed-point iterations

    tolerance : float, optional
       convergence criterion for the unmixing matrix

    Winit : numpy array, optional
       initial guess for the unmixing matrix

    Output:
    ----------
    A : numpy array
        mixing matix of size X.shape[0] x nSources

    W : numpy array
        unmixing matrix of size nSources x X.shape[0]

    S : numpy array
        matrix of independent courses, size nSources x X.shape[1]
